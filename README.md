This project is a tool for simulating n-body gravitational interactions using the Verlet Integration Method.

The GUI allows users to add, edit, and remove any number of bodies as well as change the parameters of the simulation, such as step size, number of steps, and graphing frequency.

The GUI for this project is built using [Dear PyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui).

All planetary data retrieved from NASA's [planetary fact sheet](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/).
